# LetsconnectAngularSocketTailwind

This project is part of the LetsConnect chat application, which uses Angular for the frontend and integrates with a Node.js backend powered by Socket.IO for real-time communication. It also leverages TailwindCSS for styling.

## Development server

To start the Angular development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Backend server

The backend server is located in the `letsconnect-nodejs-socket` directory. To start the backend server, navigate to the directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the Angular project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Real-time Communication

This project uses `ngx-socket-io` for real-time communication with the backend. The backend server uses `Socket.IO` to handle WebSocket connections. Events such as `EVENT_JOIN`, `EVENT_MESSAGE`, and `EVENT_CHAT` are used for communication between the frontend and backend.

## Styling

The project uses TailwindCSS for styling. Global styles are defined in `src/styles.scss`. You can customize the styles by editing this file.
